I plan to write down my journey while I uncover this old project.
~
Here, I will describe my thinking process while the commits add up over time.

The original project's environnement was already provided when I was landed the task to make this Chess game. Thus, the only configuration available was for Windows. I changed that to make sure a building process can be quickly modified for every compatible platform using QMake and Make. I wish to make it automatic in the future. Then, I was still not satisfied with the project's original folder structure, so I separated the source effectively. Another issue I encountered, was the fact that the Qt project is compiled with an older version of C++ (17), but the LSP of my IDE was not parsing the code with that information, and the IDE was also not recognizing the include path of the project. I added a .zed (for the Zed IDE), and a .clangd file (proper to the LSP) to make it work.

I changed the file naming from the original code. This is to prevent errors in Linux servers where filenames may be case sensitive. I also switch all filenames to EN (from FR). I will do the same for the code eventually. Time to clean up the code !
